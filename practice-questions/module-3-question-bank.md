### **Part A: Short Answer Questions (3 Marks Each)**

---

### Question 1 (3 marks)
**Question:** Define **Disaster Mitigation** and provide one example of a community-level mitigation measure.

**Model Answer:**
**Disaster Mitigation** refers to sustained actions taken to **permanently eliminate or reduce** the long-term risk to human life and property from hazards. Mitigation aims to reduce the *likelihood* or *severity* of impact. It is distinct from preparedness, which focuses on readying for an event. A community-level example is the **creation of local shelters on high ground** or **planting mangrove forests** along coastlines to reduce storm surge impact.

**Keywords:** Permanent reduction, Long-term risk, Eliminate, Severity, Mangrove, High ground.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Clear definition of Disaster Mitigation: 2 marks
- Valid example of a community-level mitigation measure: 1 mark

### Question 2 (3 marks)
**Question:** What is the main difference between **Structural** and **Non-Structural** mitigation measures?

**Model Answer:**
**Structural mitigation** involves physical construction or engineering modifications to resist hazard impacts (e.g., building codes, dams, embankments). **Non-structural mitigation** involves policies, laws, regulations, or knowledge development that influence human behavior and reduce vulnerability (e.g., land-use planning, early warning systems, public awareness campaigns). The key difference is that structural measures modify the hazard or environment, while non-structural measures modify human risk behavior and policy.

**Keywords:** Physical construction, Engineering, Policy, Regulations, Behavior, Land-use planning.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Definition/Nature of Structural Mitigation: 1.5 marks
- Definition/Nature of Non-Structural Mitigation: 1.5 marks

### Question 3 (3 marks)
**Question:** List the four essential components (or pillars) of an effective **Early Warning System (EWS)**.

**Model Answer:**
An effective Early Warning System (EWS) is built on four interconnected pillars:
1.  **Risk Knowledge:** Systematic collection of data and assessment of hazards and vulnerabilities.
2.  **Monitoring and Warning Service:** A technical system for detecting, monitoring, and forecasting hazards (e.g., weather satellites, seismographs).
3.  **Dissemination and Communication:** Communication of timely, clear, and relevant warnings to all those at risk.
4.  **Response Capability:** The preparedness and capacity of the population to act upon the warning (the 'last mile').

**Keywords:** Risk Knowledge, Monitoring, Dissemination, Response Capability.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Listing 3-4 components correctly: 3 marks

### Question 4 (3 marks)
**Question:** Briefly explain the concept of **Disaster Resilience** in the context of urban planning.

**Model Answer:**
**Disaster Resilience** is the capacity of a system, community, or society to **absorb, recover from, and adapt** to the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, preserving or restoring its essential basic structures and functions. In urban planning, this means ensuring that critical infrastructure (hospitals, utilities, transport networks) can withstand shocks, and that the local economy and social systems can bounce back quickly without long-term collapse.

**Keywords:** Absorb, Recover, Adapt, Timely, Critical infrastructure, Urban planning.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Definition of Disaster Resilience (absorb/recover/adapt): 2 marks
- Application in urban context (infrastructure/functions): 1 mark

### Question 5 (3 marks)
**Question:** Who are the three primary **Stakeholders** in local-level Disaster Risk Management (DRM)?

**Model Answer:**
The three primary stakeholders crucial for effective local-level DRM are:
1.  **Government Agencies/Local Authorities:** (e.g., District Administration, Municipalities, Police/Fire Services).
2.  **The Community:** (The affected population, including vulnerable groups, community leaders, and civil society organizations).
3.  **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society:** (e.g., local volunteer groups, specialized aid organizations).

**Keywords:** Local Authorities, Community, NGOs, Vulnerable groups.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Listing three distinct stakeholder groups correctly: 3 marks

### **Part B: Medium Answer Questions (7 Marks Each)**

---

### Question 6 (7 marks)
**Question:** Explain the cyclical nature of the **Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Framework**, detailing the transition between the **mitigation, preparedness, and response** phases.

**Model Answer:**
The DRM framework is a continuous cycle, not a linear process.
1.  **Mitigation (2 marks):** Occurs before a disaster, focusing on long-term risk reduction (e.g., retrofitting buildings).
2.  **Preparedness (2 marks):** Occurs before a disaster, focusing on readiness (e.g., evacuation drills, stocking supplies).
3.  **Response (2 marks):** Occurs during and immediately after the event (e.g., search and rescue, immediate relief).
4.  **Transition (1 mark):** The **Recovery** phase, following Response, is critical as it transitions back into the Mitigation phase. Lessons learned during the Response and Recovery phases (e.g., where did a road fail?) should directly inform and strengthen new Mitigation policies and future Preparedness plans, making the cycle continuous and self-improving.

**Keywords:** Continuous cycle, Long-term, Readiness, Search and rescue, Recovery, Lessons learned, Self-improving.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Explanation of Mitigation phase: 2 marks
- Explanation of Preparedness/Response phases: 2 marks
- Explanation of the cyclical transition/feedback loop: 3 marks

### Question 7 (7 marks)
**Question:** Detail three key **non-structural mitigation strategies** and explain how each reduces a specific type of risk (e.g., flood, earthquake).

**Model Answer:**
Non-structural strategies reduce vulnerability without physical construction:
1.  **Land-Use Zoning and Planning (3 marks):** **Strategy:** Restricting or prohibiting construction in high-risk zones (e.g., coastal areas prone to storm surge or river floodplains). **Risk Reduction:** Prevents the placement of assets and populations in harm's way, thus directly reducing future economic and human loss from **floods/cyclones**.
2.  **Public Awareness and Education (2 marks):** **Strategy:** Running regular campaigns, drills, and curriculum modules to inform the public on how to react during a hazard. **Risk Reduction:** Increases personal preparedness and knowledge of safe actions, reducing panic and injury/fatality rates, especially during **earthquakes** or sudden onset hazards.
3.  **Insurance and Financial Incentives (2 marks):** **Strategy:** Providing subsidized hazard insurance or offering tax breaks for homeowners who retrofit their houses above basic code. **Risk Reduction:** Spreads the financial burden of damage across a wider system (resilience) and encourages private citizens to voluntarily invest in **structural mitigation** (e.g., earthquake-proof foundations).

**Keywords:** Land-Use Zoning, Floodplains, Public Awareness, Education, Insurance, Retrofitting, Financial incentives.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Strategy 1 explained with specific risk context: 2.5 marks
- Strategy 2 explained with specific risk context: 2.5 marks
- Strategy 3 explained with specific risk context: 2 marks

### Question 8 (7 marks)
**Question:** Analyze the distinct roles and responsibilities of **Local Self-Governments (Panchayats/Municipalities)** in implementing disaster mitigation plans.

**Model Answer:**
Local Self-Governments (LSGs) are the most crucial tier for implementing mitigation as they are closest to the people and the hazards.
1.  **Enforcement of Building Codes (3 marks):** LSGs are responsible for enforcing national/state **structural mitigation** measures, such as zoning by-laws and seismic-resistant building codes. They issue permits and conduct inspections, ensuring that new construction does not increase vulnerability.
2.  **Vulnerability Mapping and Data (2 marks):** They possess the ground-level knowledge necessary for accurate participatory mapping, identifying local vulnerable spots, fragile infrastructure, and marginalized groups. They use this data to feed into district-level planning.
3.  **Local Non-Structural Measures (2 marks):** They implement **non-structural** policies like maintaining public drains and check dams, organizing community-level drills, and identifying and maintaining local evacuation routes and temporary shelters.

**Keywords:** Enforcement, Building codes, Zoning, Vulnerability mapping, Ground-level, Evacuation routes, Drain maintenance.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Role in enforcement/structural codes: 3 marks
- Role in local data/vulnerability mapping: 2 marks
- Role in local non-structural measures/preparedness: 2 marks

### Question 9 (7 marks)
**Question:** Explain the three crucial steps involved in the **dissemination and communication** component of an Early Warning System (EWS).

**Model Answer:**
The dissemination component ensures the warning reaches the at-risk population in an understandable and actionable manner:
1.  **Tailoring the Message (3 marks):** The technical warning (e.g., 'Wind speed 180 km/h') must be translated into **local, simple, and culturally appropriate language**. It must specify the *likely impact*, the *area affected*, and the *required action* (e.g., "Villagers in zone A must move to the community hall by 6 PM"). This ensures the message is clear, credible, and understandable by all groups, including the non-literate.
2.  **Redundancy and Multiple Channels (2 marks):** No single communication channel is reliable during a hazard. The warning must be broadcast via **multiple, redundant channels**‚Äîfrom digital (SMS, TV, Radio, social media) to traditional/local methods (sirens, mosque loudspeakers, beating drums, runner systems). This ensures maximum reach and reliability.
3.  **Confirmation and Feedback (2 marks):** EWS success requires knowing the warning was **received and understood**. Local authorities must use mechanisms (e.g., local volunteer feedback, police confirmation calls) to verify that the message was received by the highest-risk populations, enabling correctional action if necessary.

**Keywords:** Tailoring, Local language, Actionable, Multiple channels, Redundancy, Feedback, Confirmation.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Step 1 (Tailoring/Clarity): 3 marks
- Step 2 (Redundancy/Multiple channels): 2 marks
- Step 3 (Confirmation/Feedback loop): 2 marks

### Question 10 (7 marks)
**Question:** Describe the shift from a **relief-centric** to a **development-centric** approach in post-disaster **Recovery**.

**Model Answer:**
The approach to post-disaster recovery has fundamentally changed:
1.  **Relief-Centric Approach (Old) (3 marks):** This approach focused narrowly on **immediate survival** and restoring the status quo. It involved rapid distribution of aid (food, tents) and basic repairs, often leading to poorly built or misplaced structures, which perpetuated future vulnerability. The goal was speed, not long-term safety.
2.  **Development-Centric Approach (New) (4 marks):** This approach integrates recovery with sustainable development and **mitigation**. The mantra is "**Build Back Better (BBB)**." It involves taking the opportunity post-disaster to reconstruct essential infrastructure and housing using hazard-resistant standards, diversifying local economies, and improving social planning. The goal is to reduce future risk and enhance the community's overall resilience, making the area safer and more developed than before the disaster.

**Keywords:** Immediate survival, Status quo, Build Back Better (BBB), Hazard-resistant standards, Sustainable development, Resilience.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Explanation of the relief-centric focus (speed/status quo): 3 marks
- Explanation of the development-centric/BBB focus (mitigation/resilience): 4 marks

### Question 11 (14 marks)
**Question:** Compare and contrast **Structural and Non-Structural Mitigation Measures**, using concrete examples (Indian context preferred) to argue which approach is more sustainable for long-term disaster risk reduction.

**Model Answer:**
**Comparison and Contrast (8 marks):**
| Feature | Structural Mitigation | Non-Structural Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nature** | Physical, engineering solutions. | Policy, legal, financial, and educational tools. |
| **Cost** | High initial capital cost; high maintenance cost. | Low initial capital cost; cost mainly in enforcement and HRD. |
| **Effect** | Directly modifies the hazard or physical environment. | Directly modifies human behavior and vulnerability. |
| **Example (India)** | Construction of the **Farakka Barrage** (flood control); seismic retrofitting of old buildings in Delhi. | The **Disaster Management Act, 2005**; Land-use zoning in Mumbai coastal areas. |
| **Limitation** | Provides a false sense of security; catastrophic failure is possible; environmentally intrusive. | Requires strong political will and community compliance; slow to implement. |

**Argument for Sustainability (6 marks):**
While structural measures are necessary for controlling high-impact hazards (e.g., dams for controlling large rivers), **non-structural measures are generally more sustainable for long-term DRR.**
1.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Non-structural measures are far cheaper to implement and maintain over decades than massive engineering projects.
2.  **Holistic Risk Reduction:** They address the root causes of vulnerability (poverty, poor planning, lack of awareness) rather than just the physical impact of the hazard.
3.  **Adaptability:** They are flexible and can be rapidly adjusted (e.g., updating a building code) to respond to emerging risks like climate change, whereas structural works are fixed in design and location. Therefore, a DRM framework relying heavily on robust **non-structural policies** paired with targeted structural works provides the most sustainable path to resilience.

**Keywords:** Structural, Non-structural, Barrage, Retrofitting, Policy, Land-use zoning, Sustainability, Root causes, Adaptability, Cost-effectiveness.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Comparison table (4 differentiating points): 8 marks
- Argument for sustainability (3 key reasons: cost, holistic, adaptability): 6 marks

### Question 12 (14 marks)
**Question:** Critically discuss the importance of **Stakeholder Engagement** in all four phases of the DRM cycle (Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, Recovery). Propose a model for effective community inclusion.

**Model Answer:**
**Importance Across DRM Cycle (8 marks):**
Stakeholder engagement is essential because disasters are local events, and effective management requires local knowledge, participation, and resources.
1.  **Mitigation:** Local communities possess indigenous knowledge about past hazard events and vulnerability. Engagement ensures that mitigation measures (e.g., choosing a dam location or an evacuation route) are culturally appropriate, scientifically sound, and locally accepted.
2.  **Preparedness:** Engagement ensures that early warning messages are tailored and communicated effectively ('last mile'). Community members participate in drills, identify and maintain shelters, and create local response teams (e.g., community task forces).
3.  **Response:** Local stakeholders (community volunteers, local police, fishermen) are the true 'first responders.' Their knowledge of the terrain and immediate access to resources saves lives in the critical golden hour before external aid arrives.
4.  **Recovery:** Participation ensures recovery initiatives (e.g., reconstruction programs) address the real needs of the affected, prevents the marginalization of vulnerable groups, and fosters the essential sense of ownership required for **Build Back Better**.

**Proposed Model for Effective Community Inclusion (6 marks):**
A successful model should be decentralized, bottom-up, and continuous:
* **Establish Village Disaster Management Committees (VDMCs):** Officially recognized, multi-sectoral groups (including women, youth, and marginalized castes) responsible for localized planning.
* **Participatory GIS (PGIS) Mapping:** Use community members to create hazard, vulnerability, and resource maps. This validates local knowledge and creates a shared visual tool for planning.
* **Feedback Loops:** Establish formal mechanisms (e.g., quarterly community meetings, digital forums) where the community can audit the mitigation works, report non-compliance, and provide continuous feedback to the administration on the effectiveness of EWS or recovery programs.

**Keywords:** Indigenous knowledge, Community acceptance, First responders, Golden hour, VDMCs, PGIS, Feedback loops, Bottom-up.

**Marking Scheme Breakdown:**
- Importance analyzed across all 4 phases (2 marks each): 8 marks
- Proposed model with three clear, actionable components: 6 marks

### Question 13 (14 marks)
**Question:** Analyze the concept of **Disaster Resilience**. Detail how the principles of resilience are integrated into national and state-level post-disaster **Recovery policies** and planning frameworks.

**Model Answer:**
**Concept of Disaster Resilience (4 marks):**
Resilience is a multidimensional concept defined as the ability of a system (community, infrastructure, or economy) to anticipate, absorb, accommodate, or recover from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner, without compromising long-term development. It requires systemic improvements in capacity, robustness, and redundancy across social, economic, and physical dimensions.

**Integration into Recovery Policies (10 marks):**
The modern approach explicitly uses the recovery phase to boost resilience, moving beyond simply replacing what was lost.
1.  **"Build Back Better" (BBB) Mandate (3 marks):** This is the core principle. Policies mandate that reconstruction efforts must not only restore facilities but upgrade them to higher, hazard-resistant standards. Example: Post-Gujarat Earthquake recovery saw new building codes implemented to increase seismic resilience across the state.
2.  **Economic Resilience (3 marks):** Policies focus on rapid restoration and diversification of local livelihoods, reducing dependency on a single sector. Financial mechanisms, such as immediate loan waivers or subsidized credit for small businesses, are provided to minimize the economic "shock" and accelerate recovery.
3.  **Social Resilience and Inclusion (2 marks):** Recovery plans prioritize rebuilding social infrastructure (schools, community halls) and ensuring that the needs of vulnerable groups (women, disabled, elderly) are met first. This strengthens the social capital of the community and ensures an inclusive recovery process.
4.  **Institutional Resilience (2 marks):** Recovery planning often includes reviewing and strengthening the institutional framework itself (e.g., establishing a dedicated State Disaster Mitigation Fund or creating an independent recovery agency) to ensure future planning is faster, more equitable, and mitigation-focused.

**Keywords:** Absorb, Accommodate, Systemic improvement, Build Back Better, Hazard-resistant, Economic diversification, Social inclusion, Institutional framework.
