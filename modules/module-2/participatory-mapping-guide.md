## üó∫Ô∏è Participatory Mapping in Disaster Risk Management (DRM)

### **What is Participatory Mapping?**

**Participatory Mapping (PM)** is a community-driven process where local people actively collaborate in the creation of maps and geographic information. Unlike conventional mapping, which relies solely on professional cartographers and technical surveys, PM places the **knowledge, perspectives, and spatial understanding of residents**‚Äîwho are often the most vulnerable to disasters‚Äîat the center of the mapping activity. It converts local, indigenous, and traditional knowledge (IK) about hazards, resources, and vulnerabilities into accessible, visual tools. This process is inherently empowering, shifting the role of locals from passive recipients of aid to **active agents of change** in planning and risk reduction.

### **Main Objectives of Participatory Mapping**

The core objectives of PM are centered on democratization of knowledge and local empowerment:

1.  **Validate Local Knowledge:** To formally recognize and integrate indigenous and experiential knowledge about historical hazard events, local resource locations (e.g., safe evacuation routes, wells, high ground), and social vulnerabilities (e.g., location of elderly or disabled persons).
2.  **Raise Awareness:** To create a shared understanding within the community about the spatial distribution of risks, hazards, and vulnerabilities (e.g., "Our riverbank floods up to this point").
3.  **Empowerment and Ownership:** To encourage community **ownership** over the disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning process by having them design the solutions based on maps they created themselves.
4.  **Facilitate Dialogue:** To serve as a neutral, visual tool that promotes communication and consensus-building among diverse stakeholders, including vulnerable groups, government officials, and NGOs.
5.  **Evidence-Based Planning:** To provide local planners and policy-makers with accurate, ground-truthed data that official, generic maps may overlook.

### **Uses in Disaster Risk Management (DRM)**

Participatory maps are invaluable tools used across all phases of the disaster management cycle:

| DRM Phase | Uses of Participatory Mapping |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mitigation & Prevention** | Identifying areas for permanent **mitigation structures** (e.g., flood walls, tree planting zones) and mapping the location of fragile infrastructure (e.g., old schools, fuel pipelines). |
| **Preparedness** | Creating and marking clear **evacuation routes**, locating and assessing the capacity of safe shelter sites, and mapping key communication hubs and emergency contact points. |
| **Response** | Serving as a real-time, easily understandable guide for search and rescue teams by showing local landmarks, internal pathways, and locations of vulnerable populations. |
| **Recovery** | Mapping the extent of damage post-disaster to prioritize the allocation of recovery resources and track the rebuilding of essential services (e.g., water lines, roads). |

### **Participatory Mapping Techniques**

Different techniques are used depending on the community's resources and the required level of detail:

* **1. Sketch Mapping (Resource Mapping):** This is the simplest, lowest-cost technique. Community members use paper, pens, and markers to draw maps from memory, showing the layout of their village, including houses, roads, hazards, and resources. **Use:** Ideal for quickly capturing social knowledge and initiating dialogue.
* **2. Transect Walks:** A team walks a straight line (transect) across a landscape, jointly observing and documenting changes in topography, land use, vegetation, and vulnerability zones along the path. The results are drawn onto a cross-section diagram. **Use:** Excellent for analyzing the vertical and environmental aspects of risk, such as slope stability and proximity to flood lines.
* **3. 3D Models (Relief Maps):** These are physical, three-dimensional models of the area, often built from local materials like clay, wood, or cardboard. This technique is highly effective as it allows even non-literate members to engage with the topography. **Use:** Best for visualization of elevation changes, understanding watershed behavior, and prioritizing resource allocation based on physical terrain.
* **4. Digital Participatory Mapping (PGIS):** This involves community members using digital tools like Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, smartphones, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software to collect, digitize, and ground-truth map data. **Use:** Produces high-accuracy, easily shareable data that can be integrated directly with official databases.

### **Benefits and Limitations**

| Aspect | Benefits | Limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Community** | Fosters self-reliance and empowerment; ensures cultural relevance of plans; leverages deep local knowledge. | Can be influenced by local power dynamics or biases; participation may be low if poorly facilitated. |
| **Technical** | Generates highly detailed, accurate local data (ground-truthing); easily visualizes complex risk data. | Requires time and skilled facilitation; data standardization and integration with official GIS can be complex. |

### **Case Study**

**Case Study: Coastal Vulnerability Mapping in Odisha, India**

Following major cyclones like **Fani (2019)**, several coastal communities in Odisha engaged in participatory mapping. Local fishermen and villagers, who knew the tidal patterns and erosion rates best, created maps detailing:
1.  Historical **storm surge** inundation levels.
2.  The location of vulnerable mangrove forests (natural barriers).
3.  Safe temporary shelter spaces on sand dunes or high ground.

**Impact:** The resulting maps helped the district administration correct outdated official data, re-route evacuation plans, and prioritize the restoration of natural barriers, thus integrating local resilience strategies into state-level preparedness.

### **Integration with GIS**

The integration of participatory data with **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** transforms the value of the maps. Local sketch maps are digitized, georeferenced, and overlaid with professional layers (like satellite imagery, census data, and infrastructural blueprints). This creates **Participatory GIS (PGIS)**, which bridges the gap between grassroots knowledge and scientific data, making local plans credible and actionable for government agencies and international donors.
