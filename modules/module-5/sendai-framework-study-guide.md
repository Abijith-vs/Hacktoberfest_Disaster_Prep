# Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030)

## 1. Introduction and Historical Context

The **Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)** was adopted at the **Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction** in *Sendai, Japan (March 2015)*. It succeeds the **Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005–2015**, building upon its achievements and addressing identified gaps.

### Background Evolution
- **1989:** International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR)  
- **1994:** Yokohama Strategy for a Safer World  
- **1999:** International Strategy for Disaster Reduction  
- **2005–2015:** Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA)  
- **2015–2030:** Sendai Framework (current global blueprint for DRR)

### Rationale for the Sendai Framework
The need for a new global framework arose due to:
- Increasing disaster frequency and escalating economic losses (over **$1.3 trillion** between 2005–2015).  
- Incomplete integration of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into national development policies.  
- Growing exposure and vulnerability due to rapid urbanization, poverty, and climate change.

The Sendai Framework represents a **paradigm shift from disaster management (response)** to **disaster risk management (prevention and mitigation)** — focusing on understanding and addressing the root causes of risk.

## 2. Seven Global Targets of the Sendai Framework

The SFDRR sets **seven measurable global targets** to assess progress towards resilience:

1. **Reduce global disaster mortality**  
   - By 2030, substantially lower average disaster deaths per 100,000 people compared to 2005–2015.
2. **Reduce the number of affected people globally**  
   - Lower the number of affected people per 100,000 in 2020–2030 compared to 2005–2015.
3. **Reduce direct disaster economic loss**  
   - Decrease losses relative to global GDP by 2030.
4. **Reduce damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services**  
   - Especially health and educational facilities, by 2030 through improved resilience.
5. **Increase the number of countries with national and local DRR strategies**  
   - By 2020. *India achieved this early through NDMA and State Disaster Management Authorities.*
6. **Enhance international cooperation to developing countries**  
   - Ensure sustainable and targeted support for DRR implementation by 2030.
7. **Increase access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information**  
   - Ensure availability for all people by 2030.

## 3. Four Priorities for Action

The Sendai Framework identifies **four interlinked priorities for action**, emphasizing prevention, preparedness, and resilience.

### Priority 1: Understanding Disaster Risk
- Deepen knowledge of risk drivers — vulnerability, exposure, and capacity.  
- Promote the use of scientific data, risk maps, and early warning systems.  
- Encourage educational, scientific, and indigenous knowledge sharing.  
- **Example (India):** The **IMD’s Early Warning Systems** for cyclones in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have drastically reduced casualties.

### Priority 2: Strengthening Disaster Risk Governance
- Strengthen national and local DRR institutions.  
- Foster coordination among government levels and sectors.  
- Establish accountability mechanisms for disaster risk management.  
- **Example (India):** The **Disaster Management Act (2005)** institutionalized governance through NDMA, SDMAs, and DDMAs.

### Priority 3: Investing in Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience
- Encourage public and private investments in risk prevention and mitigation.  
- Integrate DRR considerations into infrastructure, urban planning, and development projects.  
- **Example (India):** The **National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP)** invests in resilient coastal infrastructure and shelters.

### Priority 4: Enhancing Disaster Preparedness and “Build Back Better”
- Strengthen preparedness, response, and recovery frameworks.  
- Use post-disaster recovery as an opportunity to reduce future risks.  
- **Example (India):** Post-2001 **Gujarat Earthquake reconstruction** emphasized earthquake-resistant building codes — a hallmark of the “Build Back Better” principle.

## 4. Guiding Principles

Implementation of the Sendai Framework is guided by **12 core principles** rooted in inclusivity, accountability, and scientific understanding:

1. States have the **primary responsibility** to prevent and reduce disaster risk.  
2. **Shared responsibility** across all sectors and levels of government.  
3. Protection of **human rights** and the right to development.  
4. **All-of-society engagement** — inclusion of women, youth, elderly, and persons with disabilities.  
5. Strong **coordination mechanisms** among institutions and stakeholders.  
6. **Empowerment of local authorities** through resources and autonomy.  
7. Use of **multi-hazard and risk-informed decision-making**, based on science and local knowledge.  
8. **Policy coherence** across DRR, climate change, and sustainable development.  
9. **Localization** of risk management — community-specific approaches.  
10. **Cost-effectiveness** of prevention over post-disaster recovery.  
11. Adoption of **“Build Back Better”** in recovery and reconstruction.  
12. Promotion of **international cooperation and partnership**, including technology sharing and capacity-building.

## 5. How India Has Tailored Sendai Framework Priorities

India has closely aligned its national DRR policies and frameworks with Sendai’s priorities.

### Policy and Legal Framework
- **Disaster Management Act (2005):** Provides a legal foundation for disaster governance.  
- **National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM, 2009):** Reflects principles of prevention, mitigation, and resilience.  
- **National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP, 2016):** One of the first national plans globally aligned with Sendai’s four priorities.

### Implementation Examples

#### Early Warning and Preparedness (Priority 1)
- **IMD’s Integrated Early Warning System** for cyclones.  
- **Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (INCOIS)** in Hyderabad.

#### Governance (Priority 2)
- Strengthening of **State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs)** and **District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs)**.

#### Investment in Resilience (Priority 3)
- **Smart Cities Mission** and **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)** integrate resilient urban design.  
- Implementation of **coastal and seismic zoning regulations**.

#### Build Back Better (Priority 4)
- **Post-2018 Kerala Flood reconstruction** emphasized sustainable rebuilding and community participation.

India’s DRR approach is guided by the **Prime Minister’s 10-Point Agenda for DRR (2016)**, which resonates with Sendai’s principles — emphasizing risk understanding, community resilience, and global cooperation.
