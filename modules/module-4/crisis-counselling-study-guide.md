## Definition of Crisis Counselling

**Crisis counselling** is a **short-term psychological support process** that helps people cope with **sudden, overwhelming, or life-threatening events** such as natural disasters, accidents, or personal losses.  
It aims to restore an individual's mental stability and ability to function effectively.

According to the *National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM)* and WHO guidelines:
> “Crisis counselling provides immediate emotional support and helps the affected person regain a sense of control and safety after a traumatic event.”

##  Key Differences Between Regular Counselling and Crisis Counselling

| **Aspect** | **Regular Counselling** | **Crisis Counselling** |
|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Objective** | Long-term personal growth and adjustment | Immediate emotional stabilization and safety |
| **Duration** | Long-term (weeks to months) | Short-term (often 1–6 sessions) |
| **Focus** | Deep-rooted psychological issues, behaviour change | Managing immediate distress and restoring normal functioning |
| **Approach** | Planned, structured, and insight-oriented | Active, directive, and problem-focused |
| **Client Condition** | Emotionally stable and seeking improvement | Emotionally unstable or traumatized by sudden crisis |
| **Example** | Career guidance or relationship counselling | Support after a flood, earthquake, or loss of loved one |

## Importance of Crisis Counselling in Disaster Management

During disasters such as **floods, landslides, earthquakes, and pandemics**, survivors often experience:
- **Shock, confusion, fear, and helplessness**
- **Anxiety, grief, and survivor’s guilt**
- **Sleep disturbances and depression**

Crisis counselling becomes vital because it:
1. **Prevents long-term trauma** such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
2. **Restores community functioning** by stabilizing affected individuals.
3. **Encourages resilience** and coping mechanisms.
4. **Supports decision-making** during emergency recovery.
5. **Reduces suicide risk** and harmful behaviours.

### Example (Indian Context)

- **Kerala Floods (2018):** Thousands displaced experienced trauma and anxiety. Psychologists and NGOs such as *DISHA* and *NIMHANS* provided crisis counselling in relief camps.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic:** Tele-counselling helplines (like *SAMHITA* and *NIMHANS Helpline*) supported individuals facing isolation, grief, and economic uncertainty.

These interventions helped communities regain hope, focus on rehabilitation, and prevent mental health crises.

## Techniques Used in Crisis Counselling

Crisis counsellors employ structured steps and empathetic communication techniques to help survivors recover emotionally and psychologically:

### 1. **Establish Contact and Rapport**
Create a safe and trusting environment.  
*Example:* Introducing oneself and offering calm reassurance after a disaster.

### 2. **Assess the Situation**
Understand the person’s immediate emotional and physical condition.  
Identify risk factors like suicidal thoughts or severe distress.

### 3. **Ensure Safety**
Prioritize the client’s and community’s safety (medical help, shelter, basic needs).

### 4. **Provide Support and Comfort**
Offer empathy, active listening, and reassurance. Avoid judgment or false promises.

### 5. **Examine Alternatives**
Encourage survivors to identify available coping strategies, resources, and social supports.

### 6. **Develop a Short-Term Action Plan**
Collaboratively plan practical next steps (e.g., contacting family, seeking shelter, meeting medical needs).
