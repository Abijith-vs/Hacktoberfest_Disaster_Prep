* Revise definitions & differences (e.g., OSI vs TCP/IP).
* Write to-the-point answers (2‚Äì3 lines max).
* Prepare short notes for formula-based questions.

### Part B (Long Questions)

* Choose questions covering **different modules**.
* Write structured answers (Intro ‚Üí Diagram ‚Üí Explanation ‚Üí Example).
* Use flowcharts or tables wherever possible.

### Time Management

* First 10 min: Scan question paper & mark known ones.
* 1 hr: Attempt Part A.
* 2 hrs: Write 3 Part B answers neatly with headings.

### Writing Effective Answers

* Start each answer with definition or concept line.
* Include labeled diagrams.
* Highlight key terms & underline formulae.
