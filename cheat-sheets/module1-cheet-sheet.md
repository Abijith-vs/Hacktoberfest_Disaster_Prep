Module 1 Disaster Management Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Introduces fundamental disaster management concepts, Earth's systems (Lithosphere, Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere), and key terms in Disaster Risk Reduction and Management.

## Key Topics (High Frequency ⭐⭐⭐)
- *Disaster Management:* Definition & types (Natural/Man-made)
- *Earth Systems:*
    - Lithosphere: Composition, rocks, soils
    - Atmosphere: Layers, Ozone Layer & depletion, Greenhouse Effect, Cyclones, Indian Monsoon
    - Hydrosphere: Oceans (moderator, heat/carbon reservoir, sea ice), inland water bodies, water cycle
    - Biosphere: Components (terrestrial, aquatic), interdependencies
- *DRR & DRM Key Terms:* Hazard, Vulnerability, Risk, Capacity, Resilience, EWS, Preparedness, Prevention, Mitigation, Response, Assessment

## Important Definitions
| Term                       | Definition                                                                               |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Disaster Management*    | Conserving lives/property during natural/man-made disasters.                             |
| *Lithosphere*            | Outer Earth layer (crust + solid mantle), interacts with other spheres.                  |
| *Ozone Layer*            | Stratospheric O3, absorbs harmful UV, protects life.                                     |
| *Greenhouse Effect*      | GHGs trap outgoing radiation, maintaining Earth's climate.                               |
| *Cyclone*                | Low-pressure system, inward-spiraling winds, stormy weather.                             |
| *Hazard*                 | Potentially damaging event/disruption/degradation.                                       |
| *Vulnerability*          | Susceptibility of community/system/asset to hazard effects.                              |
| *Resilience*             | Ability to adapt/recover from hazards without compromising development.                  |
| *Early Warning System*   | Socio-technical system for timely warning to enable proactive response.                  |
| *Disaster Mitigation*    | Measures to reduce/neutralize hazard impact by reducing vulnerability.                   |

## Exam Essentials
- *Atmosphere:* Layers (Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere), Ozone Layer (function, depletion by CFCs/NO), Greenhouse Effect (GHGs, impact).
- *Disasters:* Definition, Natural vs. Man-made.
- *Key DRR/DRM Terms:* Hazard, Vulnerability, Risk, Capacity, Resilience, Mitigation, Preparedness, Early Warning Systems.
- *Cyclones:* Definition, comparison with Anticyclones (pressure, wind direction, weather).
- *Indian Monsoon:* SW & NE Monsoons (origin, path, impact).

## Memory Aids
- *Atmosphere Layers (bottom to top):* *Throw **Some **Meat **To **E*d (Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, Exosphere).
- *GHGs:* *Water **Carbon **M*ethane (Water vapor, CO2, Methane).
- *SW Monsoon:* *Arabian **B*ay (Arabian Sea Branch, Bay of Bengal Branch).
- *Vulnerability Factors:* *Physical, **Social, **Economic, **E*nvironmental.

## Quick Facts
- Ozone maximum: ~22 km. Ozone Hole: <220 Dobson Units.
- Earth's axis tilt: 66.5° to ecliptic plane (causes seasons).
- Oceans cover >70% Earth, average depth ~3.7 km.
- Mean ocean salinity: ~34.7 g/kg (mainly NaCl).
- Hydrological cycle: Solar energy drives evaporation (oceans/inland), condensation, precipitation, runoff, groundwater.

## Common Questions
- Define Disaster Management & differentiate natural/man-made disasters.
- Explain atmospheric layers & Ozone Layer significance/depletion.
- Describe Greenhouse Effect, GHGs, and their impact.
- Compare Cyclones and Anticyclones.
- Elaborate on Hazard, Vulnerability, Risk, and Capacity in DRR.
- Discuss the Indian Monsoon (SW & NE) and its characteristics.
