# Module 1: Disaster Management – Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

## Overview
Covers Earth’s systems (Lithosphere, Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, Biosphere) and core disaster management concepts — hazard, vulnerability, risk, resilience, and early warning systems — forming the base for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Management (DRM).

---

## 🌍 Key Topics (High Frequency ⭐⭐⭐)
- **Disaster Management:** Natural vs. Man-made
- **Earth Systems:**
  - *Lithosphere:* Layers, composition, rocks, soils, plates
  - *Atmosphere:* Layers, Ozone Layer & depletion, Greenhouse Effect, Cyclones, Monsoon
  - *Hydrosphere:* Oceans (heat/carbon reservoirs), sea ice, water cycle
  - *Biosphere:* Terrestrial & aquatic ecosystems, interdependence
- **DRR & DRM Terms:** Hazard, Vulnerability, Risk, Capacity, Resilience, EWS, Preparedness, Prevention, Mitigation, Response, Assessment

## 📘 Important Definitions
| Term | Definition |
|------|-------------|
| **Disaster Management** | Conservation of life and property during natural or human-made disasters. |
| **Hazard** | Potentially damaging physical event, disruption, or degradation. |
| **Vulnerability** | Susceptibility of community/system to hazard impacts. |
| **Risk** | Probability of harmful consequences due to hazards interacting with vulnerability. |
| **Capacity** | Strengths/resources within a community to manage disaster risks. |
| **Resilience** | Ability to adapt and recover from hazards without compromising development. |
| **Early Warning System (EWS)** | Socio-technical setup for timely warning and proactive response. |
| **Mitigation** | Measures to minimize hazard impacts by reducing vulnerability. |

## 🧭 Exam Essentials
- **Atmospheric Layers:** Troposphere, Stratosphere (Ozone), Mesosphere, Thermosphere.
- **Ozone Layer:** ~22 km altitude; absorbs UV; depletion by CFCs, BFCs, NO.
- **Greenhouse Effect:** CO₂, CH₄, H₂O trap outgoing radiation → warm Earth.
- **Cyclones vs. Anticyclones:** Low vs. high pressure; inward vs. outward winds.
- **Indian Monsoon:** SW (June–Sept) & NE (Oct–Dec) branches, causes rainfall.
- **DRR Terms:** Hazard, Vulnerability, Risk, Capacity, Preparedness, Response.

## 🧠 Memory Aids
- **Atmosphere Layers:** *Throw Some Meat To Eat* → Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, Exosphere.  
- **GHGs:** *Water, Carbon, Methane* → H₂O, CO₂, CH₄.  
- **SW Monsoon:** *Arabian Bay Branch* → Arabian Sea + Bay of Bengal.  
- **Vulnerability Types:** *P-S-E-E* → Physical, Social, Economic, Environmental.

## ⚡ Quick Facts
- **Ozone Max:** ~22 km altitude  
- **Ozone Hole:** <220 Dobson Units (DU)  
- **Earth’s Tilt:** 66.5° (causes seasons)  
- **Ocean Coverage:** >70% of Earth, avg. depth ~ 3.7 km  
- **Sea Salinity:** ~34.7 g/kg (mainly NaCl)  
- **Hydrological Cycle:** Evaporation → Condensation → Precipitation → Runoff
